<title>Profile</title><table><tr><td style=vertical-align:top;width:50%><span style=font-size:x-large><i>Qingtian Li</i><br>About</span><br><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>As Simulation Software Engineer for Autonomous Vehicles and Machine Learning, I have had a unique opportunity to define and implement a virtual world for modeling and simulation of autonomous vehicles, sensors and vehicle based artificial intelligence. My software has recreated dynamic environments based on both recorded and synthetic data as well as virtualizations of company's autonomous robots. My software has also been critical to predicting how robots and their autonomous movement controls will behave in scenarios and gauge real-world performance. I have worked in areas related to 3D graphics rendering, physics simulations, vehicle dynamics modeling, and multi-agent systems. I have been hands on, working with teams across the company, building, designing, and shipping projects that have a positive, enduring impact on millions of people worldwide.

How I have made an impact:
Implemented simulation frameworks that recreate dynamic environments based on both recorded and synthetic data.
Built planning logics for various dynamic agents.
Collaborated with other engineers to maintain physically accurate models of sensors such as LIDARs, RADARs, cameras, IMUs, GPS units.
Developed automated regression frameworks for autonomous systems.
Built scalable frameworks to run massive amounts of simulations in a cluster environment.
Integrated with existing software practices that produce maintainable code, including automated testing, continuous integration, code style conformity, and code review.

To be successful in this role, I have needed the following skills and experience:
BS, MS or PhD in computer science, engineering, math, physics, robotics, or related field
Expertise in general game development, AI, robotics, automotive, or detailed physics simulation process
Excellent C#, C++, or Python software development skills on Linux platforms
Previous experience in writing simulation code, 3D games, or automotive simulators using software such as Gazebo, OGRE, Unity three.js, OpenRave, Drake, CGAL, Unreal
Familiarity with state-of-the-art 3D simulation framework/packages
Extensive experience developing 3D framework
Strong 3D Graphics and mathematics background
Ability to leverage AWS, Azure, or other Cloud capabilities build out a distributed system for large scale testing
Experience developing and shipping products in a commercial environment</span></td><td style=vertical-align:top;width:50%>
